BasicPrimitiveBuddy
===================

BasicPrimitiveBuddy is a library for drawing primitive shapes in xna/monogame.  Easily draw stuff like circles, lines, rectangles, etc.

This library works on Windows, Android and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
